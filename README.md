# Jamroom-Timeslot-Booking-System
Similar to a doctor's timeslot booking system, this web application is created with the objective of helping the jam rooms/recording rooms with their bookings.
The user can select the desired city (Pune/Nagpur) and then a list of Jam Rooms/Recording Rooms will be visible, on which the favourable one can be chosen and click which will bring him/her to the info page. After that, the slot booking option is down and will bring the screen to a calendar.
Only the day after the current days can be selected and on clicking, the green buttons with slots will be available to book and red ones are already booked which cannot be booked again.
The user can book multiple slots, after booking once, the screen reploads again and booked slot will appear in red.
All booking are visible in the owner's end pages.

Unzip the files and place them in a folder.
In MySQL, create tables "acoustunebookings", "frequencybookings" and others with the appropriate columns, whose names can be obtained from the booking php pages.
For owner's end, create password table and accordingly change the names in the files to match.
